# Parallelizer

With Parallelizer, you can effortlessly call multiple APIs in parallel, transform and unify the results, and receive them in a single response.

## ðŸš€ Parallelizer API Key Features:

âœ… Parallel API Calls: Send a single POST request to the /api/v1/fetch endpoint with a JSON body containing a list of endpoints, and Parallelizer will handle the rest. It will make concurrent API calls, retrieve the data, and combine it into a single response.

âœ… Transform and Unify: Customize the response data using transformations. Each endpoint can have its own set of transformations defined, allowing you to extract and modify specific data elements from the API responses.

âœ… Efficient and Fast: Parallelizer optimizes the retrieval process by making parallel requests, reducing the overall response time and improving your application's performance.

âœ… Easy Integration: The API is straightforward to integrate into your projects. Just send a POST request with the desired endpoints and transformations, and you're good to go!
